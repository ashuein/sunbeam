# SuNBEAM

This package provides code to compute the (S)pectral (N)on-(B)acktracking
(E)mbedding (A)nd Pseudo-(M)etric, or SuNBEAM for short.  The
non-backtracking matrix is a matrix representation of a graph that has deep
connections with the theory homotopy of graphs, in particular the length
spectrum function.  The eigenvalues of the non-backtracking matrix can be
effectively used to compute dissimilarity scores (or distances) between
graphs.  A previous version of the code in this repository was used in the
following paper.

# Installation

To install, simply `git clone` this repository, import the `sunbeam` module
and call the `nbd` function.  For `sunbeam` to work correctly you need to
have installed NumPy, SciPy, NetworkX, and (optionally) Matplotlib.


# Example

A minimal example of how to use `sunbeam.py`:

```
import sunbeam
import networkx as nx

# Compute distances NBD
er = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(300, 0.05)
ba = nx.barabasi_albert_graph(300, 3)
sunbeam.nbd(er, ba, 20)                      # 1.6322743723800643

# Compute embedding NBED
2*er.size(), sunbeam.nbed(er).shape[0]
(4580, 4580)

# Visualize NBED
sunbeam.visualize_nbed(er, color='target')
sunbeam.visualize_nbed(ba, color='source', log=True)
```

A more extensive example of the functionality provided in `sunbeam.py` can
be found in the [example notebook](https://github.com/leotrs/sunbeam/blob/master/example.ipynb).
